# Stewie

Stewie is an unsupervised anomaly detector written in Clojure.

Given a multivariate unlabeled input stream, Stewie detects anomalies using
statistical analysis of the input data, assuming that anomalies are rare and
that all metrics are uncorrelated and normal distributed.

The detector returns the probability density of each new point in constant time
and with constant memory requirement.

## Usage

In the REPL, use stewie.core namespace, and feed it with maps:

    => (ns test (use [stewie.core]))
    => (def det (detector))
    #'test/det
    => (det {:x 40 :y 20})
    NaN
    => (det {:x 40 :y 20.4})
    0.027916815612332915

The return value means that the probability density at `{:x 40 :y 20.4}` is `2.79%`.
