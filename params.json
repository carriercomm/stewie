{"name":"stewie","body":"![stewie](http://www.flavioribeiro.com/stewie.png)\r\n\r\n### stewie \r\nThis project is result of [FedexDay](http://\r\nwww.atlassian.com/fedex-day) at [Globo.com](http://www.globo.com). \r\n\r\nThe main idea of the project is help you on the detection of anomaly in a generic mass of data. It receives and stores generic parameters and learns how they are correlated. If some event occurs and these parameters exhibit a strange behavior, it alerts.\r\n\r\nSince we have a timebox to finish this project, more documentation about how the things work will be posted here in the next days. Basically, we used some theory from [here](http://s3.amazonaws.com/mlclass-resources/docs/slides/Lecture15.pdf). \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJuarez Bochi (@jbochi)\r\n\r\nFl√°vio Ribeiro (@flavioribeiro)\r\n\r\nIgor Sobreira (@igorsobreira)\r\n\r\nLuiz Lemos (@luizlemos)\r\n\r\n### Sponsor (pizza, hosting and stuff in general :-)\r\n\r\n![Globo.com](http://www.flavioribeiro.com/globo.com.png)","tagline":"system for anomaly detection in mass generic data","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
